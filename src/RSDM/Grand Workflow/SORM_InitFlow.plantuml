            This scenario is for
            - Service already in CMDB
            - Service already onboarded in REDB

            It means:
            - User wants to init new Service in other Environment
            - OR User wants to update default Regions to be deployed

            Consequently, we will need to integrate
            - Entity Init flow for respective NEW entities
            - REDB to fetch new data for given Service upon ASJP processing<
